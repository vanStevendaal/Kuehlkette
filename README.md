## Cooling Verifaction

This Python program is a comprehensive solution for monitoring and verifying cold chains by analyzing data from a SQL database. It utilizes a connection to the database to identify specific transport operations and verify if they meet the established requirements. This project was developed as part of a training program for certified technicians.

## Features

 1. Database Connection: Initializes a connection to a SQL database using the "pyodbc" library to access transport data.
 2. Retrieval and Selection of Transport IDs: Extracts a list of all transport IDs from the database and allows the user to select a specific ID for inspection.
 3. Data Extraction: For the selected transport ID, retrieves all associated records from the database and writes them into another list.
 4. Analysis by Subprograms: The program utilizes three specialized functions to check the integrity and efficiency of the transport. The explanation of these functions is provided on the next page.
 5. Result Evaluation: Informs the user about the outcome of the checks. In case of violations against the criteria, detailed warning messages are issued.
 6.Repeatable Checks: The program runs in a continuous loop, allowing to choose a new transport ID after each analysis and repeat the inspection.

## Functions

Three specialized functions have been written to check the database for consistency and completeness. The following functions were developed:

1. check_consistency: This function checks a list to see if it follows certain rules: Each time something starts with "In," the next one must end with "Out." Two identical terms (both "In" or both "Out") consecutively are not allowed, and the very first term must be "In." If everything fits, it says "all good," if not, it explains what the problem is.

2. check_time_difference: This function checks a list to ensure that the times for "In" and "Out" are sensible: "Out" must always happen after "In," and if someone "Outs" and then "Ins" again, that break cannot be longer than 10 minutes. If everything is correct, the function says everything is fine. If not, it explains what the problem is.

3. check_transport_duration: This function checks if the entire operation, from start to finish, lasts less than 48 hours. If the process takes longer, the function says "not okay." If it's shorter, it says "all good."
